This respository contains code and data used to estimate habitat constraint metrics for walleye pollock in the Bering Sea.  Code for extimating habitat constraints for the remaining 9 species examined in Ciannelli et al. 2021 follows the pollock template, and is avilable upon request.
This repository also contains data to estimate relationshps between habitat constraint and ontogenetic index acorss all 10 case studies examined in Ciannelli et al. 2021.
